# PUBLISHING (/canonic/machine/os/writing/paper/publishing)

inherits: /canonic/machine/os/writing/paper

---

## Axioms

### 1. Triad

A PUBLISHING scope **MUST** contain the following artifacts:

- `CANON.md`
- `VOCAB.md`
- `README.md`

Absence of any triad artifact renders the PUBLISHING scope invalid.

---

### 2. Inheritance

This CANON **MUST** inherit all axioms from its parent scope.

- Inherited axioms are final.
- This CANON **MUST NOT** override or contradict inherited axioms.
- Inheritance terminates at the root scope.

---

### 3. Introspection

`VOCAB.md` **MUST** define every concept used by:

- this CANON
- `VOCAB.md` itself

Undefined concepts render the PUBLISHING scope invalid.

---

### 4. Dissemination-only scope

PUBLISHING exists to disseminate evidence-bearing artifacts.

- PUBLISHING **MUST NOT** modify or reinterpret evidence.
- PUBLISHING **MUST NOT** introduce new governance or enforcement.

---

### 5. Evidence anchoring

Every published artifact **MUST** reference the freeze tag and evidence window
used to produce it.

---

### 6. Time-to-publication disclosure

PUBLISHING output **MUST** disclose:

- the freeze timestamp and commit hash
- the publication timestamp and artifact identifier
- the elapsed time between freeze and publication

---

### 7. Minimality

PUBLISHING governance **MUST** remain minimal.

---

**This CANON defines validity for PUBLISHING.**
**Interpretation and narrative remain in PAPER.**
