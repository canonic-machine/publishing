# PUBLISHING (/canonic/machine/os/writing/paper/publishing)

inherits: /canonic/machine/os/writing/paper

## Axioms

### 1. Dissemination-only scope

PUBLISHING exists to disseminate evidence-bearing artifacts.

- PUBLISHING **MUST NOT** modify or reinterpret evidence.
- PUBLISHING **MUST NOT** introduce new governance or enforcement.

---

### 2. Evidence anchoring

Every published artifact **MUST** reference the freeze tag and evidence window
used to produce it.

---

### 3. Time-to-publication disclosure

PUBLISHING output **MUST** disclose:

- the freeze timestamp and commit hash
- the publication timestamp and artifact identifier
- the elapsed time between freeze and publication

---

### 4. Minimality

PUBLISHING governance **MUST** remain minimal.

---

## Inherited Constraints

This scope inherits from PAPER:
- **Triad** (PAPER Axiom 1): CANON.md, VOCAB.md, README.md required
- **Inheritance** (PAPER Axiom 2): Inherited axioms are final
- **Introspection** (PAPER Axiom 3): VOCAB defines all concepts

---

**This CANON defines validity for PUBLISHING.**
**Interpretation and narrative remain in PAPER.**
